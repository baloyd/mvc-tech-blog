# mvc-tech-blog

This app is a CMS-style blog site where the user is prompted to login or create an account to view the contents of the site. From there, the user can view posts and comments, create posts of their own and leave comments on other posts.
The app is an example of the MVC paradigm since it uses Sequelize as the ORM that handles the Model, Handlbars as the templating language that handles the View and the express-session npm package that handles the authentication and represents the Controller.

To seed the database:
node seeds;

Start Server
node server.js
